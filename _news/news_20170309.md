The MegaGlest team is proud to release v3.13.0  
Notable improvements to this release include:

*   Multi-building select and key-binding for production of units Buildings of the same type can be added to a control group, which means multiple units can be produced with a single click.
*   bugfix: A crash (out of sync) that sometimes happened when playing with Fog-of-War disabled has been fixed.
*   improved AI behavior
*   To help keep multi-player games more balanced and to ensure that players are practiced enough to harvest resources and beat a normal CPU, a scenario is automatically launched the first time a user tries to enter the lobby. The scenario must be won before the player can actually enter the lobby.
