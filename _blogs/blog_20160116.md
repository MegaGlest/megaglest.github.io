Did you know that MegaGlest can be told to do much more than just launch the game?  

For example you can launch your own headless game server using:  

```
--headless-server-mode=x,x	Run as a headless server.
	Where x is an optional comma delimited command
	list of one or more of the following: 
		exit - which quits the application after a game
			has no more connected players.
		vps  - which does NOT read commands from the
			local console (for some vps's).
		lan  - which does not broadcast the hosting server
			to the masterserver (for local LAN games).
```

example to run a server that anyone on your home network can join:  

`megaglest --headless-server-mode=lan`

Now when you search for LAN games to join it will connect to this server.  

To find out which opengl video drivers are registered on your system run:  

`megaglest --opengl-info`

For people who write mods / factions there are an abundant number of validation features that you can use to verify the quality of your work:  

`megaglest --validate-factions=my-new-faction`

Feel free to run it on tech for example:  

`megaglest --validate-factions=tech`

To show a list of maps, techtrees or scenarios you can run:  

`megaglest --list-maps
megaglest --list-techtrees
megaglest --list-scenarios
megaglest --list-tilesets`

There are many other neat little goodies available.  
To get a full verbose list of commands run megaglest from its folder in a command prompt:  

`megaglest --help`
