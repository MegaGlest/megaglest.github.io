_Free Software_ is software which is not just free-to-download, as in free-to-play, free demo / alpha (where you will still need to pay to get a copy the full thing), but also free as in giving you freedom. Freedom to do (almost) anything you want with it. It is very much about sharing and equal opportunity.

MegaGlest is entirely _Free Software_, that is, both the complete source code and all the game assets (art) are available under the GPL and compatible licenses, for you to [**inspect and review**](https://github.com/MegaGlest "MegaGlest source code"), to learn from, to [**improve upon**](https://github.com/MegaGlest/megaglest-source/pulls "MegaGlest source code pull requests"), to [**file bugs**](https://github.com/MegaGlest/megaglest-source/issues "MegaGlest source code issue tracker") against and to [**modify**](https://github.com/MegaGlest/megaglest-source/network "(Some) forks of the MegaGlest source code") as you like. You could even take the game as it is, [**modify it entirely and re-release it under a new name**](http://annexconquer.com/ "Annex - Conquer the World, a MegaGlest engine based game").

And that is what we, do, too. Not with MegaGlest, but with all the tiny (or not so tiny) pieces of other peoples' software which MegaGlest is comprosed of. And there are plenty of these. MegaGlest is is not the work of just a few people. While the current number of regular direct [**contributors**](/development) to MegaGlest is limited, dozens of people have been involved in crafting all the softwares which finally end up as this game on your hard disk. It is only because of this that we can afford to develop this game in our spare time, next to our social life, daily routine, and our other hobbies.

![**We love Free Software!**](/assets/ilovefs-long-large-en.png)Which is why, today, we wish to show our deep appreciation to the developers of all of these software which MegaGlest makes use of, as well as developers of _Free Software_ in general. And we encourage you to do the same - [**show your love and appreciation for _Free Software_**](http://ilovefs.org/ "Free Software Foundation campaign #ilovefs")!

Here's an incomplete list of the many other software development efforts which allow us to reuse their code so we can assemble MegaGlest:

*   [**Glest**](http://glest.org/ "Glest - the free real-time strategy game") (which MegaGlest is a fork of)
*   [**Apache Software Foundation**](http://www.apache.org/)
*   [**Xiph.Org foundation**](http://xiph.org/) (Vorbis audio format and en-/decoder)
*   [**Feathery FTP**](https://sourceforge.net/projects/feathery/ "Feathery FTP client") (modified version)
*   [**libcurl**](http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/)
*   [**libpng**](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html)
*   [**libjpeg**](http://www.ijg.org/)
*   [**wxwidgets**](http://www.wxwidgets.org/)
*   [**Lua**](http://www.lua.org/download.html)
*   [**OpenAL**](http://www.openal.org/)
*   [**ZLib**](http://www.zlib.net/)

While MegaGlest could not exist without these softwares, the same goes for all the liberally licensed images, models, music and sounds, fonts etc. we reuse, and the communities which make these reusable.Thank you very much!
